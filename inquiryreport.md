# Problem
We would like to find ways to give users recommendations.

# Question
1. How do places like Netflix and Pandora recommend things to their users?
2. Do we need the users to rate things, or can we base it off previous listening choices?

# Resources
1. [Netflix Interview]
2. [Collaborative Filtering]

### 1. Mini-abstract and relevence of [Netflix Interview]
In this interview, Carlos Gomez-Uribe, VP of product innovation and personalization algorithms, and Xavier Amatriain, engineering director, answer questions about how Netflix algorithms decide what you'll watch next.  It isn't a technical description, yet it still gives a fair answer to question 1.

### 2. Mini-abstract and relevence of [Collaborative Filtering]
This chapter of A Programmer's Guide to Data Mining by Ron Zacharski - the whole [book] can be found here - has many examples for getting started with recommendation systems. The chapter also provides many formulas that one can use to compare two users to see if one of their rating cwould be a good or bad recommendation for the other user.  This resource answers the question 2: the methods described here require a rating system.
